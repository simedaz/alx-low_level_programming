### About C programming
### 

### 
#### Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
> gcc $CFILE -E -o c

### 
#### Script that compiles a C file but does not link.
> gcc -c $CFILE

### 
#### Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
> gcc -S $CFILE

### 
#### Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
> gcc -S $CFILE

### 
#### Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun
> gcc $CFILE -o cisfun

### 
#### A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

```
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void)
{
puts("\"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle");
return (0);
}
```

### 
#### A C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.

```
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void)
{
printf("with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,\n");
return (0);
}
```

### 
#### A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
```
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void)
{
	int a;
	long int b;
	long long int c;
	char d;
	float f;

	printf("Size of a char: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(d));
	printf("Size of an int: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(a));
	printf("Size of a long int: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(b));
	printf("Size of a long long int: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(c));
	printf("Size of a float: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(f));
	return (0);
}

```


### 
#### Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
```
#!/bin/bash                                                                     
gcc -S -masm=intel $CFILE

```

#### A C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
```
#include <unistd.h>

/**
 * main - Entry point

 */
int main(void)
{
write(2, "and that piece of art is useful\" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19\n", 59);
