# alx-low_level_programming #
- **This repo is all about low level programming in C according the curriculum used by ALX build our computer science foundations.**

DIRECTORIES | PRACTISED CONCEPTS
----------- | ------------------
0x00-hello_world | very basics of C.
0x01-variables_if_else_while | Understanding variables and basics of conditional statements(if...else statements) and loops.
0x02-functions_nested_loops | Introduction to functions and nested loops.
0x03-debugging | Important debugging techniques.
0x04-more_functions_nested_loops | Here we practiced more on functions and nested loops...deepening our understanding.
0x05-pointers_arrays_strings | We began our journey with pointers, arrays, and strings...looking at the connection between these concepts.
0x06-pointers_arrays_strings | This was a deep learning curve, learnt a lot and was confused by a lot. Took me some time to understand.
0x07-pointers_arrays_strings | Another deeper look into these concepts, my brain is still hurting from this.
0x08-recursion | Haha!!! Another confusing computer science concept, I am still trying to understand this further. But it was a superb learning experience.
0x09-static_libraries | I love this part...creating a static library from all object files in a project has a lot of benefits...I will put links to articles that butresses all these concepts below.
0x0A-argc_argv | Sometimes, one needs to receive command line arguments into a program especially when creating command line tools.
0x0B-malloc_free | Here I learnt how to allocate memory dynamically using `malloc` and `free`. Was a wonderful learning experience. Implemented some inbuilt functions and some tricky task in order to better understand the concepts.
0x0C-more_malloc_free | Here we looked deeper into allocating memory dynamically on the heap, because sometimes the amount of memory to be used by the user is not predictable. We also implemented `calloc` and `realloc` using only `malloc` function. Remember, we are 95% of the time not allowed to use standard library except `stdlib.h`.
0x0D-preprocessor | Learning about preprocessor directives that makes our program more efficient.
